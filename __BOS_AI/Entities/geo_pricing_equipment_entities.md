# BOS Entity — sq_ft_break_points

Entity Type ID: `sq_ft_break_points`
Storage: ECK

## Purpose
- Area-based pricing breakpoint tables for lawn services. Referenced from `config_pages:business_setting`.
- Each record defines a sq footage range and the rate that applies within that range.

## Bundles
- `aeration` — aerating rate breakpoints
- `dethatching` — dethatching rate breakpoints
- `overseeding_labor` — overseeding labor rate breakpoints (hours per 1,000 sq ft)
- `overseeding_seed_markup` — overseeding seed markup percentage breakpoints

## Key Fields
- `title` — breakpoint label
- `field_min_sq_ft` — minimum sq footage for this tier
- `field_max_sq_ft` — maximum sq footage for this tier
- `field_rate` — rate for this tier (decimal; meaning varies by bundle: price for aeration/dethatching, hours/1k for overseeding_labor, markup % for overseeding_seed_markup)

## Invariants
- Read by `wo_aerating` and `wo_dethatching` modules to calculate billing based on `property_landscape_details.field_turf_sq_footage`.
- Ranges must be contiguous and non-overlapping — gaps or overlaps cause billing errors.
- Do not delete active breakpoint records — billing stops working.

## Deletion / Archival
- Reference data. Modify in place; do not delete active tiers.
